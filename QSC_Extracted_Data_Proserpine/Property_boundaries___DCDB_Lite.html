The data is updated nightly and can be downloaded by searching the Q Spatial web site for "Cadastral Data Queensland".</div><em>Additional Information: </em><div>The Digital Cadastral Database is the spatial representation of every current parcel of land in Queensland, and its legal Lot on Plan description and relevant attributes. It provides the map base for systems dealing with land related information. The DCDB is considered to be the point of truth for the graphical representation of property boundaries. It is not the point of truth for the legal property boundary or related attribute information, this will always be the plan of survey or the related titling information and administrative data sets.<br/><br/>This polygon layer is a 'lite' version of the base cadastre in the Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) showing minimal attribute data about the property boundaries. The dataset does not contain information on volumetric, strata lots, multi level building format lots or secondary interest such as easements and covenants. A complete extract of the state or by an individual local government area is available from the Queensland Spatial Catalogue. <br/><br/>From the 30 November 2015, there will no longer be reference to Parishes and Counties in the Departments land information systems, including the Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) – a computerised map of property boundaries and related description of all land parcels in Queensland. <br/><br/>The Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy will retain a record of parishes and counties for historical purposes. The Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying provides historical information about parishes and counties and the historical parish directory is available online.<br/>If you obtain information or products from QSpatial, either the information will no longer contain parish and county details, or the parish and county fields will contain the words ‘no longer used’.<br/><br/>Further details about accuracies and other attributes can be found in the Queensland Interchange Format document available on the internet – type in ‘DCDB QIF Specifications’ in an internet search tool to locate.</div><em>Language: </em>eng<br/><em>Character set: </em>unknown<br/></div><h2 class="headTitle">Topic</h2><div><em>ISO topic category codes: </em>planningCadastre<br/></div><h2 class="headTitle">Spatial Data Information</h2><div>

The base parcels are contiguous with surrounding base parcels. The graphic package and the routines that extract and reload update data to the database has a tolerance of 2mm on the ground. This tolerance may become significant in some proprietary systems and therefore an allowance will be necessary.<br/>

This value reflects 'maximum error' status of the polygons and has been derived from the capture process or assigned as the DCDB data has been upgraded. For this extraction, the 'maximum error' of parcels, expressed as a value, ranges from and a data sourced statement. It has been established that the positional accuracy of the DCDB should include a finite value representing the 'maximum error' based on the source map type, the scale and a digitising value component. Positional accuracy values are expressed in metres at a 95% confidence level.<br/>

                        <br/>                                The attributes in the DCDB are acquired from a number of sources within the Department. The following attributes are attached to each polygon in the lite version of the DCDB based on the polygon centroid: lot on plan attribute, positional accuracy value, object code which is a unique number for each polygon created on each download extraction and length/area values which are calculated from the geometry of the polygon based on the coordinate reference of the data being downloaded. The lot on plan attribute can have a one to many relationship with the polygons. The original validation process consisted of the visual inspection and or comparison of hard copy output compared to the departmental cadastral working maps and update plans. New update plans are committed to the database through a supervisor signoff process. There are several system validation procedures in the maintenance process and these are run at a required frequency. The estimated accuracy of the attribute information is 98%.<br/>

                <h2 class="headTitle">History:</h2><div>
                    <em>Lineage statement:</em><div>The DCDB was created by digitising existing cadastral maps at a variety of scales and accuracies. These mapping scales ranged from Standard 1:2500 to 1:250000, Provisional 1:2500 to 1:253400 and mapping such as Parish and Town maps. At the initial capture, existing control identified from the Survey Control Database, topographic maps, photogrammetric and orthophoto compilations were used as part of the digitising process. A positional accuracy value has been allocated to all parcels in the DCDB. The value reflects the maximum error status of the parcel and has been derived from the capture process or assigned as the DCDB has been upgraded. The maximum error at the time of capture ranged from +/- 1.5m to +/- 637m. The maximum error status is based on an assumed plotting accuracy for the source mapping. Positional errors can exceed this value, due to a range of factors including the accuracy of the information that was used to prepare the source mapping.<br/>At the time of the graphical capture, a segment/parcel number was allocated to uniquely describe each parcel of land. Attribute information collected from plans and maps was then linked to the segment/parcel number to form the relationship between the graphics and the attributes. A double entry process of keying in the attributes was done to eliminate any keying in errors. <br/>The DCDB is continuously updated by inputting boundary measurements from registered plans and from attribute updates from government gazettes and other administrative notifications. The department has a client service standard that 90% of all new registered plans be entered into the DCDB within 7 working days of the plan being registered in the titling system.</div>
